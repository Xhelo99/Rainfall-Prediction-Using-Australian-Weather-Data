This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning classifier to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using real-world weather data from Australia.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/) and includes weather observations across multiple cities from 2008 to 2017. It was downloaded from Kaggle: [Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).
